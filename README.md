- Hi, I’m @Ruthless990. Real name Ilya.
  
- I’m interested in switching my profession to a software engineer. I am uncertain of what I am good at yet, so I'm just learning.
- I’m currently learning to code with CS50 as a start and looking to move on to full time C. What will happen after is anyone's guess.
- I know a little bit of html and css, enough to read and understand, but not enough to actually write anything complex.
- If you'd like to contact me please refer to the email in my profile.
